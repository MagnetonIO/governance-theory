\begin{abstract}
This paper explores the transformative potential of Citizen Dividends in revolutionizing wealth distribution, redefining ownership, and restoring public trust in democratic capitalism. Inspired by models such as the Alaska Permanent Fund, we present a comprehensive policy framework for implementing a nationwide Citizen Dividend. We examine its legal, economic, and social implications, as well as its role in a data-driven, post-industrial economy.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The idea of a Citizen Dividend is simple but powerful: every American should receive a regular share of the nation\textquoteright s collective wealth. Whether derived from natural resources, data licensing, or the digital economy, the principle of shared economic benefit has deep roots in both democratic theory and economic justice.

\section{Conclusion: Ownership in the 21st Century}
